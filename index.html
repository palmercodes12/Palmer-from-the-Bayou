		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm the coolest Minature Schnauzer ever to have exsisted. I was born in 2012 near Eglin AFB where my dad was going to EOD training. I also went to training. Puppy training that is. Mom taught me how to sit, stay, lay, and play dead by the time I turned 8 months old. That's about the same time dad finished his training too and we moved across the country to begin our adventure together as a family. I'm very alert and a protective kind of guy so I took great care of my mom in our new home when dad had to deploy to Afganistan.</p>

		<h2>My Little Sis</h2>
		<p>My parents thought I could use some company of my own kind so we got a Pug and named her Beverly. Boy, she is a piece of work! For starters, she acts like she's never seen a mustache before. Probably because she's a puppy. But that's no excuse to use me as her personal jungle gym. She's crazy! And she looks crazy too. See for yourself...</p>
